My plan

General questions:
What is this person trying to do, and why?
I am trying to evalute the impact of economics growth on the higher education expansion. For example, will higher education is likely to occur in a county with higher foreign direct investment per capita?

What have they done so far?
So far I have otained the dataset (both higher education dataset and economics dataset) and merged by zipcode for China's higher education expansion study;

What are they working on?
I am not sure if my merge makes sense(I merged twice, the first time merged by Zipcode, the second time to merge by population1990). It looks a little bit messy.Needs to take a deep into it.I am not sure how to do the merge (many-many)in R. I did the merge many to many using Stata. But I prefer to do it in R.

How much progress are they making? Have they hit a snag? 

Have they left out something important from consideration?

The next step:
This week:Check the merge results;
Next week: primary analysis;

I am checking the potential clustering solution. 
Kmeans did not work well, But the complete/single/ ward methods works well

I have fixed checked the merge results. It is very good. Cannot find nothing wrong;

Prefecture analysis---Both OLS with fixed effect and Logit model fits well.

Urban analysis- Same thing. These results/findings are quiet different.

Questions/Potential concerns for this week: Fit both model with the weight variable.
